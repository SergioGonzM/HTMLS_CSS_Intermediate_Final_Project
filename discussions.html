                <h4>Why to play Residen Evil Village?</h4>
                <p>
                    Resident Evil Village is a 2021 survival horror game developed and published by Capcom. It is the sequel to Resident Evil 7: Biohazard
                     (2017). Players control Ethan Winters, who searches for his kidnapped daughter in a village filled with mutant creatures. 
                     Village maintains survival horror elements from previous Resident Evil games, with players scavenging environments for items 
                     and managing resources. However, it adds more action-oriented gameplay, with higher enemy counts and a greater emphasis on combat.

                    Resident Evil Village was announced at the PlayStation 5 reveal event in June 2020 and was released on May 7, 2021, for Microsoft Windows, 
                    PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Stadia, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. It received generally favorable reviews, with praise for its gameplay, 
                    setting, and variety, but criticism for its puzzles, boss fights and performance discussion-texts on the Windows version; the increased focus on action 
                    divided opinion. Resident Evil Village won year-end accolades including Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards.
